# ROBLOX-Random-String-Generator
This is a quick random string generator I created for ROBLOX. It should work with synapse, idk about anything else lol. You can choose how many chars you want, and if you want to include symbols. The generated string will be automatically copied to your clipboard, so you can generate and paste with ease!

# HOW TO USE

Simply, execute the loadstring below, then at the top of the GUI that appears, input your character amount (number) and if you want symbols (click to change), then press generate

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/O8Ur1GCJKW8FgFsDEq7R/ROBLOX-Random-String-Generator/master/Random%20String%20Generator.lua"))()
